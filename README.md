# Statistical Analysis of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset contains samples with potential Breast Cancer [from the following study](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.56.707&rep=rep1&type=pdf). According to documentaion,  

"Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image."

Goals of Analysis:
1. Clean and explore the breast cancer cata
2. Classify whether a sample has breast cancer or not based on its attributes

For item 2, we plan to make a model that takes in a Sample ID corresponding to several ranked attributes and classifies the sample as benign or malignant. Therefore the input features will be the 9 descriptive characteristics and the output variable will be the class AKA the presence or absence of Breast Cancer.
